# Advanced  Pattern Lock Based Authentication System
## Description
- Now a days PIN, Password and Pattern lock are most using security methods. But they are not fully secured. They can fail to secure       smartphones due to shoulder surfing attack, Brute force attack, Dictionary attack, etc. So we came to an Advanced version of pattern     locking system.
- These Application have pattern based authentication which allows the user to overlap each point of the pattern upto 5 times and every   time when user overlaps the pattern the color of pattern will change.Multiple users can use this application. 
- This Application is more convenient because human can easily adopt patterns rather than PIN or password.It also provides more security   by having more number of combinations than traditional pattern locking system 

## Modules and there Description
- User Registration:

	In this module user must register by specifying the pattern.

- User specifies the pattern

	User must use registered pattern to open the application. He can specify the pattern maximum 5 times in opposite directions as 	         well as he can overlap the pattern.

- Login

	Here user will enter the User-Id which was generated automatically at the time of registration in User-Id field. This Id gets incremented by 1 when new user gets registered.
